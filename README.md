# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing hotel booking cancellation data for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. The objective is to extract meaningful insights into guest behavior, identify trends in cancellations, and provide actionable recommendations for reducing cancellation rates.
Key Insights

    Guest Type Analysis:
        Couples were the most frequent bookers and also had the highest cancellation rates.
        Analysis was performed on different guest types including families, couples, and singles.
    Room Preferences vs. Assignments:
        Analysis showed what rooms guests wanted versus what rooms were assigned to them.
        Room mismatch was not found to be a significant factor in cancellations.
    Monthly Trends:
        Reservations and cancellations were visualized on a monthly basis using column charts.
    Cancellation Distribution:
        Pie charts were used to show the distribution of cancellations based on guest type and room status.
    Additional Insights:
        Various other insights were derived from the data to better understand booking and cancellation patterns.
